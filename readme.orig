vimdb 0.3 - simple Database with Vim

description:
This plugin is useful to store data in a database like Arangement

WARNING
1.) The plugin is still in an early state of development, do not store
    important data using the plugin!
2.) The script sets the global variable "virtualedit" to "all", this
    may cause problems in conjunction with other scripts (see :h
    virtualedit)
3.) Beware that a lot of autocommands are in use; look into the
    script, to see, where they apply.

short introduction:
Create a *.vimdb file and open it with Vim. Notice, that two windows
will open, the "table view" on the left and the "record view" on the 
right. The table view will show your database in the normal table 
layout, the record view will show the actual record, the cursor is 
currently over (in an empty database, of course, you will see two 
empty windows).
Move the cursor into the record view and press "o" or "O" to create a
new table column. Name the column and press ESC, a new column will be
created on the left side in the table view. Repeat that several times.
Now, after creating some columns, switch back to table view and create
a new record by pressing "o" or "O". Whilst your cursor is on the new
record, switch back to record view and hit i to edit the first Entry
of the new record. Move the cursor to some other record and do it
again!
Congratulations, you created a new database

useful mappings:
  
  In record view:
  "o", "O" - create a new column
  "yy"     - copy column
  "dd"     - cut column
  "p", "P" - paste column
  
  In table view:
  "o", "O" - create a new record
  "yy"     - copy record
  "dd"     - cut record
  "p", "P" - paste record
